## Introduction
***Strategy simulation*** is an activity that involves simulating historical events. Players take on the role of historical decision makers and navigate the **political**, **economic**, **military**, **diplomatic**, **public opinion**, and **intelligence** aspects of the game.  

Diplomacy, public opinion, and intelligence content are subject to a more mature ***Model United Nations rules*** of procedure for reference. This activity involves free consultation and organized core consultation mechanisms, with strict norms for document writing.  

For political, economic, military, and other intelligence aspects, we mainly refer to common elements in ***strategy games*** to build relevant mechanisms. The **4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) concept** is specifically addressed, while also incorporating academic research results on measurement methods in related fields to improve the simulation mechanism.  

This project focuses on computer simulation of **numerical computation**. The game interface and subsequent visualization are yet to be explored and developed.

## Call for Contributions
The project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!  

Writing code isn’t the only way to contribute to NumPy. You can also:  

- review pull requests
- help us stay on top of new and old issues
- develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials
- help with outreach and onboard new contributors
- write grant proposals and help with other fundraising efforts

Our preferred channels of communication are all public, but if you’d like to speak to us in private first, contact our community coordinators at xiashj21@lzu.edu.cn or on Slack (write xiashj21@lzu.edu.cn for an invitation).  

If you are new to contributing to open source, [<u>this guide</u>](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) helps explain why, what, and how to successfully get involved.
