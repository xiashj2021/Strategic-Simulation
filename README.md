# Strategic-Simulation
Lanzhou University Strategy Simulation System

## Introduction
***Strategy simulation*** is an activity that involves simulating historical events. Players take on the role of historical decision makers and navigate the **political**, **economic**, **military**, **diplomatic**, **public opinion**, and **intelligence** aspects of the game.  

Diplomacy, public opinion, and intelligence content are subject to a more mature ***Model United Nations rules*** of procedure for reference. This activity involves free consultation and organized core consultation mechanisms, with strict norms for document writing.  

For political, economic, military, and other intelligence aspects, we mainly refer to common elements in ***strategy games*** to build relevant mechanisms. The **4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) concept** is specifically addressed, while also incorporating academic research results on measurement methods in related fields to improve the simulation mechanism.  

This project focuses on computer simulation of **numerical computation**. The game interface and subsequent visualization are yet to be explored and developed.
